Description
This project is showing the ability to populate, read, and write text with express.js. Once installed, run the application by typing node index.js in the terminal within the directory of the install. You will then need to run this in your browser at localhost:3001. You may also follow the Heroku link below to run this application without node installed on your system. My motivation for this project was to show the capabilities of writing routes through a local host and displaying the information on a front end application. This project helps the user make a list of notes that will be persistent in the application. This also shows the capabilities of using existing code to connect back-end javascript functions.
